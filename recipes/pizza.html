        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most
            hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process.
            It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as
            pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:

            After you're finished mixing the ingredients,
            allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5
            minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax,
            making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="inglists">
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="stepslist">
            <li>Step: Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza
                pan.</li>
            <li>Step: Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Step: Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a
                stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
            <li>Step: Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step: Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle</li>
            <li>Step: Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Step: Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Step: Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool
                for 5 minutes before serving</li>
